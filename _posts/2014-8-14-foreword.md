Foreword
========
 People say that the programmers who haven't a blog isn't a good programmer.
 So, as you see, I built and wrote a blog.

 I have to say, I'm not a good programmer, but I have a heart to becoming a best programmer!
 As the saying goes, "The soldier who doesn't want to be a general isn't a good one."
 Since that I must strengthen myself.
 I usually say I'm the man will be the One Piece, and then, my little companions say you'll be the husband of One Piece.![](/assets/images/foreword/picknose.gif)

 In order to strengthen myself in my English, I intend to write my blog in English.
 It's not to say how good my English is.
 I just want to improve my writing in English.
 But some little companions say that my article will be difficult to understand.
 So when I feel I'm difficult to write in English or I want to write something literary, I'll do that in Chinese.
 So, please help me to translate to English when you see I wrote in Chinese.
 And when you see somewhere in my article are wrong or not so exact, please point out my defect by sending me a email. My email is <strong>fu0110@live.com</strong> which is also pasted on [the About](http://gustfu.github.io/about.html).
 I'll be very grateful to you.

 And then, I want to share my archive on this blog.

 Coder isn't a coder.

 Coder is a artist ……
